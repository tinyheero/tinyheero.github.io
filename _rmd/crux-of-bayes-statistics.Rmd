If you are in some field that has data (which is a lot of
fields these days), you will have undoubtly encountered the term Bayesian 
statistics at some point. When I first encountered it, I did what most people 
probably do. I googled "What is Bayesian statistics?". After reading through 
some resources and getting through the idiosynatric terms/concepts (e.g. conjugate 
priors, posteriors, Markov Chain Monte Carlo), I still went away not really 
understanding what was so important about Bayesian statistics.

It wasn't until I took the course "[Introduction to Bayesian statistics using BUGS" (offered by the MRC Biostatisics Unit from the University of Cambridge)](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/training/short-courses/bayescourse/) did an "Ah ha" moment hit 
me. Suddenly, it became clear to me what the hype was all about. Once I got the 
"crux" of it, I felt like this set me up for the rest of Bayesian thinking. As 
such, I hope to be able to share this same "Ah ha" moment I had in this post.

# I'm all 'bout that uncertainty, 'bout that uncertainty, no certainity

That was my lame and sad attempt at trying to come up with some catching section
name (inspired by [Meghan Trainor's "All About That Bass"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PCkvCPvDXk)) 
to describe the crux of Bayesian statistics. But joking aside, the one concept 
that is fundamental to Bayesian statistics is that it's all about representing 
uncertainty about an unknown quantity. To illustrate this, imagine I had the 
following coin (this is a Canadian penny):

<div style="text-align:center">
  <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/f8/Canadian_Penny_-_Obverse.png"/>
</div>

If I flipped this coin, what is the probability that the coin lands on a head? 
You most likely guessed 0.5, which is a reasonable guess given your prior 
knowledge on how coins work. But what if I told you that I got this coin from a 
magic shop? You'll probably have some doubts that it is 0.5 now. It could be 
anything now. Maybe it's a trick coin that always gives you head (i.e. 1 
probability) ? Or maybe it always gives you a tail (i.e. 0 probability)? Or 
maybe it is biased towards towards some value (e.g. 0.75 probability). 
**The point is there is some uncertainty in your estimation of this unknown 
quantity.**

So let's say I wanted to flip this coin <span class="inlinecode">n</span> times. 
We can represent the number of expected heads (<span class="inlinecode">$r_{n}$</span>) 
as follows:

<div>
$$r_{n} \sim Binomial(\theta, n)$$
</div>

Here we are just saying that the (<span class="inlinecode">$r_{n}$</span>) is
distributed as a binomial distribution, which is parameterized by 
<span class="inlinecode">$\theta$</span> (probability of getting a head) and
<span class="inlinecode">$n$</span> (number of flips/trials).

Now let's consider the following question:

<div>
$$P(\theta_{1} < \theta < \theta_{2} | n, r_{n})$$
</div>

Verbosely put, what's the probability that this coin gives a head 
(<span class="inlinecode">$\theta$</span>) is between <span class="inlinecode">$\theta_{1}$</span> 
and <span class="inlinecode">$\theta_{2}$</span> given you have <span class="inlinecode">$n$</span> 
flips and <span class="inlinecode">$r_{n}$</span> heads. In 
classical/frequentist statistics, this question actually makes no sense. This is 
because in classical statistics, parameters (unknown quantities) are fixed and 
have no uncertainty in their value; They are either that value or they are not. 
**But in a Bayesian world, we are never completely certain about any estimations.**
As such, all estimations of an unknown quantity (e.g. the probability that a coin gives a head) have some degree of uncertain.

# How do we represent these uncertainities?

We have learned that that it's all about the uncertainty in our estimations.
So how do we actually represent these uncertainities?  They are expressed as a 
[probability distributions]({% post_url 2016-03-17-prob-distr %}).  For 
instance, imagine you had the following probability distribution:

```{r uncertainty_as_prob_distr, fig.height = 5}
library("magrittr")
library("ggplot2")

data.frame(x = c(0, 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x)) +
  stat_function(fun = dbeta, n = 101, args = list(shape1 = 5, shape2 = 5)) +
  ylim(c(0, 2.8)) +
  xlab("Probability of a head") +
  ylab("Density") +
  ggtitle("Uncertainity of a coin's probability of giving a head") +
  # Credible interval arrow
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = 0.26, xend = 0.74, y = 0.75, yend = 0.75),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))
  ) +
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = 0.74, xend = 0.26, y = 0.75, yend = 0.75),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))
  ) +
  geom_label(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.9, label =  "90% credible interval")) +
  # 95% area < 0.75
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = 0.74, xend = 0.125, y = 0.05, yend = 0.05),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))
  ) +
  geom_label(aes(x = 0.5, y = 0.2, label =  "95% area < 0.75")) +
  # MAP value
  geom_segment(
    aes(x = 0.6, xend = 0.5, y = 2.6, yend = 2.5),
    arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.2, "cm"))
  ) +
  geom_label(aes(x = 0.73, y = 2.6, label = "Most likely value"))
```

The x-axis represents the plausible values that the (<span class="inlinecode">$\theta$</span>) 
could take. The y-axis represents the "confidence" (this isn't entirely accurate in 
mathematical terms, but will suffice for this example) that the probability of a 
head takes this value. By expressing our uncertainty as a probability 
distribution, we get these benefits:

* The x value with the highest density peak represents the most likely value. In
  this case, that would be 0.5.
* Credible intervals (CI) can be formed. For instance, [0.25 - 0.75] forms a 90% 
  CI that tells us we are 90% confident that the parameter is in this interval. 
  This is quite different from a confidence interval in classical statistics, 
  which is actually quite a counter-inituitive statistic (see my "[How do I Interpret a Confidence Interval? post"]({% post_url 2015-08-25-how-to-interpret-a-CI %})).
* No "p-value" calculations. Just calculate the relevant tail areas. 
  For instance, what is <span class="inlinecode">$P(\theta) < 0.75$</span>? We just look at the area left of 0.75,
  which ends up being 0.95 of the total area. So we can say there is a 95% 
  chance of <span class="inlinecode">$P(\theta) < 0.75$</span>.
* There is a technique called Bayesian inference that allows us to adapt the 
  distribution in light of additional evidence (see my "[How to Do Bayesian Inference 101"]({% post_url 2017-03-08-how-to-bayesian-infer-101 %}). This ultimately means we 
  can update our estimation of our quantity when we get more data while still
  accounting for our prior information on the quantity.

# Where do these probability distributions for representing uncertainty come from?

While you could theoreticaly make your own probability distributions, in 
practice people use established probability distributions (e.g. beta, normal).
For instance, here are 6 different beta distributions:

```{r beta-prior, fig.asp = 0.7, fig.width = 8, message = FALSE, fig.cap = "Different beta distributions"}
library("tibble")
library("cowplot")
library("glue")

# Cowplot overrides the default ggplot2 theme. This sets it back to the default
# theme.
theme_set(theme_grey())

beta_params_df <-
  tribble(
    ~ beta_distr_num, ~ shape1, ~ shape2,
                   1,      0.5,      0.5, 
                   2,        1,        1, 
                   3,        5,        1, 
                   4,        5,        5, 
                   5,        5,       20, 
                   6,        50,     200
  )

#' Plots a beta distribution 
#'
#' @param in_data List of arguments for the beta density function (dbeta)
#' @return ggplot plot
plot_beta <- function(in_data) {
  # Create aliases for easier reference below
  cur_shape_1 <- in_data[["shape1"]]
  cur_shape_2 <- in_data[["shape2"]]

  data.frame(x = c(0, 1)) %>%
    ggplot(aes(x)) +
    stat_function(
      fun = dbeta, 
      n = 101, 
      args = list(shape1 = cur_shape_1, shape2 = cur_shape_2)
    ) +
    ylab("Density") +
    xlab("Probability of a head") +
    ggtitle(glue("Beta({cur_shape_1}, {cur_shape_2})"))
}

beta_plots <- 
  split(beta_params_df, seq_len(nrow(beta_params_df))) %>%
  lapply(plot_beta)

plot_grid(
  plotlist = beta_plots, 
  ncol = 3, nrow = 2, 
  labels = LETTERS[1:6],
  align = "v"
)
```

**Each of these beta distributions represents a different prior knowledge**. 
For instance, Beta(0.5, 0.5) represents a belief that the coin always gives 
heads or tails. Beta(1, 1) represents a global uncertainty in that the 
probability of a head could be any value (this is often referred to as an
uniform prior). Beta(50, 200) represents a strong belief that the probability is
0.2 for getting a head.

Which type of distribution (e.g. beta, normal) depends on the type data you are
modeling.

# So what do I do with this uncertainty probability distribution?

If we go back to the original scenario with the coin and recall this 
equation representing the number of expected heads:

<div>
$$r_{n} \sim Binomial(\theta, n)$$
</div>

Rather than having our <span class="inlinecode">$\theta$</span> value as a 
single point estimate, we have it represented as a probability distribution 
representing all possible estimates with associated levels of uncertainity. 
**This is effectively what Bayesian statisticans mean when they say setting a 
prior on a uncertain parameter.** In this case, we will use a beta distribution
as our prior.

<div class="alert alert-dismissible alert-info">
<h4>Heads Up!</h4>
It's worth noting that in theory you can use any distribution. However in 
practice, certain prior distributions are used for specific models because it 
makes the math easier. These are called conjugate priors. I won't go into the 
details in this post, but is worth knowing this if you come across this term.
</div>

So we what we will literally do here is substitute the beta distribution into 
the binomial distribution (this forms what is called a beta-binomial) and then 
we can generate some expected outcomes. As you might guess, the shape of your 
beta will influence your expected outcomes. For instance, here we test the 
different effects of the 6 beta distributions on the distribution of the 
expected number of heads if we were to flip a coin 20 times:

```{r implications-of-a-prior, message = FALSE, fig.width = 12, fig.height = 10}
library("dplyr")

plot_prior_prediction_distr <- function(in_data) {
  # Create aliases for easier reference below
  cur_shape_1 <- in_data[["shape1"]]
  cur_shape_2 <- in_data[["shape2"]]

  num_sims <- 1000 
  num_trials <- 20

  thetas <- rbeta(num_sims, shape1 = cur_shape_1, shape = cur_shape_2)
  coin_flip_df <- 
    tibble(
      trial_no = seq_len(num_sims),
      theta = thetas,
      heads = rbinom(num_sims, num_trials, thetas)
    ) %>%
    mutate(heads = factor(heads, levels = 0:num_trials))

  prior_p <- plot_beta(in_data)
  predictive_p <- 
    coin_flip_df %>%
    ggplot(aes(x = heads)) +
    geom_bar() +
    xlab("Number of heads") +
    ylab("Number of simulations") +
    # So that the x-scale includes 0 - num_trials so that we can compare across
    # plots
    scale_x_discrete(drop = FALSE)

  plot_grid(prior_p, predictive_p, nrow = 2)
}

beta_predictive_plots <- 
  split(beta_params_df, seq_len(nrow(beta_params_df))) %>%
  lapply(plot_prior_prediction_distr)

plot_grid(
  plotlist = beta_predictive_plots, 
  ncol = 3, nrow = 2, 
  labels = LETTERS[1:6],
  align = "v")
```

In each panel, the top plot is the beta prior distribution representing the 
uncertainty in your <span class="inlinecode">$\theta$</span> parameter for your
binomial. Then the bottom plot is approximate distribution of heads you would 
get if you use the corresponding beta prior (its an approximation because we are 
running a monte carlo simulation to estimate the distribution). This bottom plot
is formally called a prior predictive distribution. As you can see, the 
bottom plots end up following the shape of the beta prior, which is actually 
what you would expect. 

# Conclusions

You've made it to the end of the post! Hopefully this post helped illuminate
the key concept of Bayesian statistics. Remember that it is all about 
representing uncertainty regarding an unknown quantity. This uncertainty is
represented with a probability distribution and ultimately impacts your expected
outcome. As probability distributions are used, this is what makes Bayesian 
statistics fundamentally probabilistic.
